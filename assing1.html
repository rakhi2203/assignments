    <b>Cooking</b> is my favorite hobby because it is a process of preparing food by applying heat. 
    It's a fundamental aspect of human culture, involving both art and 
    science to transform raw ingredients into <i>palatable, digestible, and nutritious meals.</i></p>  
<br>
<p>
It allows individuals to <u>explore</u> different cuisines, experiment with flavors, and develop new skills, all while potential
    ly reducing stress and fostering social connections. </p>
